<!-- Make a checklist application.

It should list the tasks you have set yourself.
On clicking, items should be marked complete, with strike-through text and a checkmark. Hint: don't just add an checkbox input - it'll be more difficult than you think*
If they are clicked again, they can be unchecked.
It should have an input field at the top, so you can add new items to the checklist. -->
